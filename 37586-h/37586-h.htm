<h1><i>Women&#8217;s Bathing and Swimming Costume
in the United States</i></h1>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The evolution of the modern swim suit from an unflattering,
restrictive bathing dress into an attractive, functional costume is
traced from colonial times to the present. This evolution in style
reflects not only the increasing involvement of women in aquatic

The nature of the style changes in aquatic dress
were influenced by the fashions of the period, while functional
improvements were limited by prevailing standards of modesty.
This mutation of the bathing dress to the swim suit demonstrates
the changing attitudes and status of women in the United States,

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Women&#8217;s bathing dress holds a unique place in
the history of American costume. This specialized
garb predates the age of sports costume which
arrived during the last half of the 19th century.
Although bathing dress shares this distinction with
riding costume, the aquatic garb was merely utilitarian
in the late 18th century while riding costume had
a fashionable role. From its modest status, bathing
gowns and later bathing dresses became more important
until their successor, the swimming suit,
achieved a permanent place among the outfits worn
by 20th century women. The social significance of
this accomplishment was best expressed by Foster
Rhea Dulles, author of <i>America Learns to Play</i>, in 1940,
when he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The modern bathing-suit ... symbolized the new status
of women even more than the short skirts and bobbed
hair of the jazz age or the athleticism of the devotees of
tennis and golf. It was the final proof of their successful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
assertion of the right to enjoy whatever recreation they
chose, costumed according to the demands of the sport
rather than the tabus of an outworn prudery, and to
enjoy it in free and natural association with men.<a name="FNanchor_1"
id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></div>

<p>Since the prescribed limitations of women&#8217;s role in
any given period are determined and affected by
many social factors, the evolution of the bathing
gown to the swimming suit may not only be dependent
upon the changes in the American woman&#8217;s way of
life, but also may reflect certain technological and
sociological factors that are not readily identifiable.
The purpose of this paper is to describe the changes
in women&#8217;s bathing dress and wherever pertinent
to present the factors affecting these styles.<a name="FNanchor_2"
id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Anyone who attempts to research the topic of swimming
and related subjects will be confronted with a
history of varying reactions. Ralph Thomas, in 1904,
described his experiences through the years that he
spent compiling a book on swimming:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When asked what I was doing, I have felt the greatest
reluctance to say a work on the literature of swimming.
People who were writing novels or some other thing of
little practical utility always looked at me with a smile of
pity on my mentioning swimming. Though I am bound
to say that, when I gave them some idea of the work, the
pity changed somewhat but then they would say &#8220;Why
don&#8217;t you give us a new edition of your Handbook of
Fictitious Names?&#8221; As if the knowledge of the real name
of an author was of any importance in comparison with
the discussion of a subject that more or less concerns every
human being.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p></div>

<p>Such reactions toward research about swimming
probably discouraged many serious efforts of writing
about the subject. Its scant coverage and even omission
in histories of recreation or sports may be explained
by the fact that swimming cannot be categorized
as simply physical exercise, skill, recreation, or
competitive sport. In trying to determine the extent to
which women swam in times past it is frustrating to
observe the historians&#8217; masculine bias in researching
and reporting social history.</p>

<p>A study of women&#8217;s bathing dress meets with similar
problems, and while a discussion of bathing dress can
evoke considerable interest, its nature is usually considered
more superficial than serious. Descriptions of,
and even brief references to, bathing apparel for women
are very scarce before the third quarter of the
19th century. Before this time only decorative costume
items were considered worthy of description and bathing
costume was not in this category. It is only within
comparatively recent times that costume historians
have conceded sufficient importance to bathing dress
to include meaningful descriptions in their research.</p>

<p>Participation in water activities was widespread in
the ancient world although the earliest origins of this
activity are unknown. For example, in Greece and,
later, in Rome, swimming was valued as a pleasurable
exercise and superb physical training for warriors.
The more sedentary citizens turned to the baths which
became the gathering point for professional men,
philosophers, and students. Thus bathing and swimming,
combined originally to fulfill the functions of
cleansing and exercise purely for physical well being,
developed the secondary functions of recreation and
social intercourse.</p>

<p>With the rise of the Christian church and its
spreading anti-pagan attitudes, many of the sumptuous
baths were destroyed. Christian asceticism also
may have contributed to the decline of bathing for
cleansing. In addition there was a secular belief that
outdoor bathing helped to spread the fearful epidemics
that periodically swept the continent. Although
there is isolated evidence that swimming was valued
as a physical skill,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a
href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> swimming and bathing all but
disappeared during the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>In 1531, long after the Middle Ages, Sir Thomas
Elyot wrote of swimming that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There is an exercise, whyche is right profitable in extreme
danger of warres, but ... it hathe not ben of longe tyme
muche used, specially amoge noble men, perchaunce some
reders whl lyttell esteeme it.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p></div>

<p>This early English writer gave no instructions, but expounded
on the value of swimming as a skill that
could be useful in time of war.</p>

<p>It herewith becomes necessary to differentiate
between bathing and swimming with their attendant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
goals, for it was the goals of each activity which influenced
the associated customs and costume designs.
For this discussion we shall define bathing as the act
of immersing all or part of the body in water for
cleansing, therapeutic, recreational, or religious
purposes, and swimming as the self-propulsion of the
body through water. When we refer to swimming it is
necessary to distinguish whether it was considered
a useful skill, a therapeutic exercise, a recreation, or a
competitive sport. Thus it is important to note that
while bathing for all purposes and swimming as a
physical exercise, recreation, and sport died out
during the Middle Ages, the latter continued to be
valued as a skill, particularly for warriors. This
function of swimming survived to form the link
between the ancients and the 17th century.</p>

<p>According to Ralph Thomas, the first book on
swimming was written by Nicolas Winmann, a professor
of languages at Ingolstadt in Bavaria, and
printed in 1528. The first book published in England
on swimming was written in Latin by Everard Digby
and printed in 1587. As Thomas has stated, Digby&#8217;s
book</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>... is entitled to a far more important place than the
first of the world, because, whereas Winmann had never
(up to 1866) been translated or copied or even quoted by
any one, Digby has been three times translated; twice
into English and once into French and through this latter
became and probably still is the best known treatise on
the subject.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></div>

<p>This French version was first published in 1696 with
its purported author being Monsieur Melchis&eacute;desh
Th&eacute;venot. In his introduction Th&eacute;venot indicates
that he has made use of Digby&#8217;s book in his own
treatise and that he knows of Winmann&#8217;s publication.
The English translation of Th&eacute;venot&#8217;s version became
the standard instruction book for English-speaking
peoples. Typically, his reasons in favor of men swimming
were based on its being a useful skill (i.e., to
keep from being drowned in a shipwreck, to escape
capture when being pursued by enemies, and to attack
an enemy posted on the opposite side of a river).<a name="FNanchor_7"
id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In the 18th and 19th centuries numerous other
publications on swimming appeared&mdash;too numerous
to deal with in this paper. Nevertheless, the refinement
of the art of swimming was not related to the number
of instruction books. Few of these books actually
offered new insights in comparison with those that
were outright plagiarisms or filled with misinformation.
In the meantime, bathing was reintroduced and
as this activity became more widespread swimming
was regarded as more than a useful skill, but only for
men.</p>

<p>There is little evidence of women bathing or swimming
prior to the 17th century; these activities seem
to have been exclusively for men. Nevertheless,
Thomas refers to Winmann as writing, in 1538, that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>at Zurich in his day (thus implying that he was an elderly
man and that the custom had ceased) the young men and
maidens bathed together around the statue of &#8220;Saint
Nicolai.&#8221; Even in those days his pupil asks &#8220;were not the
girls ashamed of being naked?&#8221; &#8220;No, as they wore
bathing drawers&mdash;sometimes a marriage was brought
about.&#8221; If any young man failed to bring up stones from
the bottom, when he dived, he had to suffer the penalty
of wearing drawers like the girls.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></div>

<p>Thomas goes on to say that the only evidence he had
found of women swimming in England in early days
was in a ballad entitled &#8220;The Swimming Lady&#8221; and
dating from about 1670. Despite these isolated references
it was not until the 19th century that women
were encouraged to swim.</p>

<p>After its decline in the Middle Ages, bathing
achieved new popularity as a medicinal treatment
for both men and women. In England this revival
occurred in the 17th century when certain medical
men held that bathing in fresh water had healing
properties. The resultant spas, which were developed
at freshwater springs to effect such &#8220;cures,&#8221; expanded
rapidly as the number of their devotees increased.
By the mid-18th century, rival practitioners claimed
even greater health-giving properties for sea water
both as a drink and for bathing. An economic benefit
resulted when, tiny, poverty-stricken fishing hamlets
became famous through the patronage of the wealthy
in search of health as well as pleasure.</p>

<p>When the early colonists left England in the first
half of the 17th century, the beliefs and practices they
had acquired in their original homes were brought to
the new world. Thus, it is important to note that
during this period in Europe, swimming was a skill
practiced by few, primarily soldiers and sailors. It
was not until the second half of the century that
bathing for therapeutic purposes was becoming
popular in the old world.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>The earliest reference to women&#8217;s bathing costume
has been quoted previously in Winmann&#8217;s amazing
description of mixed bathing at Zurich. He referred
to women, wearing only drawers, bathing with men
as a custom no longer practiced when he wrote his
book in 1538.</p>

<p>One of the earliest illustrations of bathing costume
I have located is part of a painted fan leaf, about
1675, that was reproduced in volume 9 of Maurice
Leloir&#8217;s <i>Histoire du Costume de l&#8217;Antiquit&eacute;</i> in 1914. In
one corner of this painting, which depicts a variety
of activities going on in the Seine and on the river
banks at Paris, women are shown immersing themselves
in water within a covered wooden frame. They
are wearing loose, light-colored gowns and long
headdresses. An English source of the late 17th century
described a very similar costume.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The ladye goes into the bath with garments made of
yellow canvas, which is stiff and made large with great
sleeves like a parson&#8217;s gown. The water fills it up so that
it&#8217;s borne off that your shape is not seen, it does not cling
close as other lining.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p></div>

<p>In the course of my contacts with other costume
historians I have encountered the belief that women
did not wear any bathing costume before the mid-19th
century. Supporting this theory I have seen a reproduction
of a print, about 1812, showing women
bathing nude in the ocean at Margate, England, but
the evidence already presented indicates clearly that
costume was worn earlier. Also certain English secondary
sources refer to a nondescript chemise-type of
bathing dress that was worn during the first quarter
of the 19th century. Because little study has been given
European bathing costume, it is not possible to conjecture
under what circumstances costume was or was
not used. We do know, however, that when bathing
became popular in the new world bathing gowns
were worn by some women in the old.</p>

<hr class="c25" />
<h2>Cultural Environment</h2>

<p>As many European cultural traits were transmitted
to the new world via England, so was the
introduction of water activities. Nevertheless it
required a number of years for such cultural refinements
as bathing to take root in the new environment.
The early colonists brought with them a limited
knowledge of swimming, but they did not have the
leisure to cultivate this skill. In New England the
Puritan religious and social beliefs were as restrictive
as the lack of leisure time. In this harsh climate,
self-indulgence in swimming and bathing did not
fulfill the requirements of being righteous and useful.
Thus the growing popularity of bathing among the
wealthy in Europe during the 17th and early 18th
centuries had little initial impact in the new world.</p>

<p>Although swimming as a skill predated the introduction
of bathing to the new world, I will first
discuss bathing since the customs and facilities established
for it reveal the development of swimming
in America, first for men and then for women.</p>

<h3>BATHING</h3>

<p>One of the earliest sources showing an appreciation
of mineral waters for bathing in the new world is
a 1748 reference in George Washington&#8217;s diary to
the &#8220;fam&#8217;d Warm Springs.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a
href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> At that time only
open ground surrounded the springs which were
located within a dense forest.</p>

<p>Another entry for July 31, 1769, records his departure
with Mrs. Washington for these springs (now
known as Berkeley Springs, West Virginia) where
they stayed more than a month. They were accompanied
by her daughter, Patsy Custis, who was
probably taken in hope of curing a form of epilepsy
with which she was afflicted. In the latter part of the
18th century hundreds of visitors annually flocked
to these springs. Although the accommodations were
primitive, we early note that the avowed therapeutic
aims for visiting these waters were very quickly
combined with a growing social life on dry land.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Rude log huts, board and canvas tents, and even covered
wagons, served as lodging rooms, while every party
brought its own substantial provisions of flour, meat and
bacon, depending for lighter articles of diet on the &#8220;Hill
folk,&#8221; or the success of their own foragers. A large hollow
scooped in the sand, surrounded by a screen of pine brush,
was the only bathing-house; and this was used alternately
by ladies and gentlemen. The time set apart for the ladies
was announced by a blast on a long tin horn, at which
signal all of the opposite sex retired to a prescribed
distance, ... Here day and night passed in a round of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
eating and drinking, bathing, fiddling, dancing, and
reveling. Gaming was carried to a great excess and
horse-racing was a daily amusement.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p></div>

<p>The more permanent bath houses found at the
increasing number of springs in the early 19th
century were really only shanties built where the
water bubbled up. Nevertheless, as civilization moved
in upon these resorts, the current taboos and mores
were soon imposed. These gave rise to customs,
facilities, and inventions peculiar to the pastime.
The more permanent facilities carefully separated
men from women. Frequently the women&#8217;s bath
was located a considerable distance from the men&#8217;s
and surrounded by a high fence. Female attendants
were at hand to wait upon the ladies, and private
rooms were prepared for their use both before and
after bathing.</p>

<p>In the early 19th century the fame of Berkeley
Springs was eclipsed temporarily by the growing
popularity of other springs, such as Saratoga in the
north and White Sulphur Springs in the south. The
newest facilities, however, and the completion of
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, restored Berkeley
to its former prosperity in the early 1850s.</p>

<p>The bath houses at Berkeley Springs in the 1850s
are an example of the facilities that were considered
convenient, extensive, and elegant during this period.
The gentlemen&#8217;s bath house contained fourteen
dressing rooms and ten large bathing rooms. In
addition to the plunge baths, which were twelve
feet long, five feet wide, and four and a half feet deep,
the men had a swimming bath that was sixty feet
long, twenty feet wide, and five feet deep. The
ladies&#8217; and men&#8217;s bath houses were located on
opposite sides of the grove. As if this were not reassuring
enough, we are told that the building for
the weaker sex was surrounded by several acres of
trees. Thus protected, feminine bathers could choose
either one of the nine private baths or the plunge
bath, which was thirty feet long by sixteen feet
wide and four and a half feet deep, as well as use
a shower or artificial warm baths.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The differences between the two bath houses show
that women were not as active in the water as the
men. Judging from the kind of facilities that were
provided at Berkeley Springs, the ladies did less
&#8220;plunging&#8221; than the men and no swimming.</p>

<p>Although accepted in England, bathing in <b>salt</b>
water did not become popular in the new world
until some time after bathing at springs was established.</p>

<p>In 1794 a Mr. Bailey announced that he planned
to institute &#8220;bathing machines and several species of
entertainment&#8221; at his resort on Long Island.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a
href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> &#8220;A
machine of peculiar construction for bathing in the
open sea&#8221; was advertised a few years later by a hotel
proprietor at Nahant, Massachusetts.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14"
class="fnanchor">[14]</a> There is some
question as to what the term &#8220;bathing machine&#8221;
describes. Existing records show that W. Merritt of
New York City received a patent dated February 1,
1814, for a &#8220;bathing machine.&#8221; Unfortunately neither
a description nor a drawing can be found today.
European patents from the first half of the 19th
century reveal that a bathing machine could be a
contraption in which an individual bathed in privacy.
This is what the above quotations seem to be describing.
In general usage, however, &#8220;bathing machine&#8221;
could also have been a device in which an individual
removed his clothing to prepare for bathing; this
type will be described later.</p>

<p>By the early 19th century floating baths were
established in every city of any importance including
Boston, Salem, Hartford, New York, Philadelphia,
Washington, Richmond, Charleston, and Savannah.
One bath located at the foot of Jay Street in New
York City was described as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The building is an octagon of seventy feet in diameter,
with a plank floor supported by logs so as to sink the
center bath four feet below the surface of the water, but
in the private baths the water may be reduced to three or
even two feet so as to be perfectly safe for children. It is
placed in the current so always to be supplied with ocean
and pure water and rises and falls with the tide.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a
href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p></div>

<p>As was true at the springs, men and women were
segregated; but in the floating baths they were only
separated by being in different compartments rather
than in different bath houses.</p>

<p>Although there were a number of these baths there
were not enough to cover all of the inviting river banks
and sea shores. There are many instances of men enjoying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the water of undeveloped shores and there is
some evidence of women venturing into the bays and
rivers (<a href="#Fig2">fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p>Nevertheless, few women ventured into the open
ocean during the early 19th century. They were
generally afraid to brave the force of the ocean waves
with only a female companion, since prevailing
attitudes regarding the proper behavior of a lady
prevented them from being accompanied by a man.
When a few ignored this dictate, their bold actions
gave rise to &#8220;ill-founded stories of want of delicacy on
the part of the females.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a
href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> An unbiased traveler,
who gave an account of this mixed bathing in 1833,
stated that parties always went into the water completely
dressed and for that reason he could see no
great violation of modesty. Mixed bathing at the
seashore (<a href="#Fig3">fig. 3</a>) was gaining acceptance, however,
when it was reported only thirteen years later that
&#8220;... ladies and gentlemen bathe in company, as is
the fashion all along the Atlantic Coast....&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_17"
id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

Library.</i>)</p></div>

<p>In place of the dressing rooms available in the floating
baths, special facilities were frequently provided.
The bathing machine&mdash;in this case a device in which
one changed clothes&mdash;was used where there was a
gentle slope down to the water. This species of bathing
machine was a small wooden cabin set on very
high wheels with steps leading down from a door in
the front. The bather entered and, while he was
changing, the machine was pulled into the sea by a
horse. When water was well above the axles the horse
was uncoupled and taken ashore. The bather was
then free to enter the sea by descending the steps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
pointed away from the shore (<a href="#Fig4">fig. 4</a>). Machines of the
18th and early 19th century were frequently equipped
with an awning which shielded the bather from
public view as she or he descended the steps to enter
the water. These awnings were left off the bathing
machines during the last half of the 19th century.
Such machines were used to a great extent in Europe
during the 18th and 19th centuries. In the United
States, however, they were used only to a limited
extent during the first half of the 19th century. By 1870
they had practically disappeared&mdash;being replaced by
the stationary, sentry-box type of individual structure
and the large communal bath house.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig4" id="Fig4"></a>
<img src="images/illo19.png" alt="Bathing at Newport, 1858" width="500" height="339" />
<p class="caption">Figure 4.&mdash;&#8220;<span class="smcap">The Bathe at Newport</span>,&#8221; by
Winslow Homer, <i>Harper&#8217;s Weekly Newspaper</i>, September 1858.<br />
(Smithsonian photo 59665.)</p></div>

<p>&#8220;Sentry-boxes&#8221; were used before the 1870s at
beaches where the terrain did not encourage the use
of the bathing machines. At Long Branch, New
Jersey, and at one of the beaches at Newport, Rhode
Island, lines of these stationary structures were available
to the bather for changing, one half designated
for women and the other half for men. Hours varied
but it was the practice to run up colored flags to
signal bathing times for the ladies and then the gentlemen.
A male correspondent wrote from Newport
in 1857:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If you are social and wish to bathe promiscuously, you
put on a dress and go in with the ladies, if you want to
cultivate the &#8220;fine and froggy art of swimming,&#8221; unencumbered
by attire, you wait until the twelve o&#8217;clock
red-flag is run up&mdash;when the ladies retire.<a name="FNanchor_18"
id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p></div>

<p>From its early beginnings, in the late 18th and
early 19th century, the summer excursion to the resorts
and spas grew in popularity. In 1848, a writer of a
Philadelphia fashion report explained that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Very few ladies of fashion are now in town, most of them
being birds of passage during the last of July and all of
August. Most Americans seem to have adopted the
fashion of visiting watering-places through the summer.<a name="FNanchor_19"
id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p></div>

<p>As the summer excursion became a social event,
the recreational possibilities of bathing overshadowed
its earlier therapeutic function. Bathing became
part of an increasingly elaborate schedule of activities
where each event&mdash;bathing, dining, concerts, balls,
promenades, carriage rides&mdash;had its appointed time,
place, and proper costume.</p>

<p>In addition to stiff ocean breezes, seaside resorts
had an extra appeal that beguiled visitors away
from the spas&mdash;namely mixed bathing. For during
the bathing hour at the seashore all the stiffness
and etiquette of select society was abandoned to
pleasure.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Again and again I try it. Deliriusm! I forget even Miss
<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;,</span> and dive headforemost into the billows. I rush
to meet them. I jump on their backs. I ride on their
combs, or I let them roll over me.... I am in the
thickest of the bathers, and amid the roar of waves, am
driven wild with excitement by the shouts of laughter;
burst of noisy merriment, and little jolly female shrieks of
fun. All are wild with excitement, ducking, diving,
splashing, floating, rollicking.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p></div>

<p>Thus bathing was transformed from a medicinal
treatment to a pleasurable pursuit.</p>

<p>Excursionists had to be hardy individuals, firm
in their resolve to complete their trip. Although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
many railroad lines had been completed by the
1850s, transportation problems were by no means
solved. For example, a New York tourist who planned
to enjoy a summer at Lake George had to travel by
boat from New York City to Albany and Troy,
then by railroad to Morean Corner, and, finally,
by stage to the lake. After listing the difficulties
endured by excursionists, a particularly embittered
correspondent commented in 1856, &#8220;... we envy
these happy people in nothing but the power to
be idle.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>By the 1870s, travel facilities were rapidly being
improved and many new summer resorts were
established which appealed to a larger segment of
the population.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Comparatively few can stay long at one time at the springs
or seaside resorts, and hence the peculiar value of arrangements
like those for enabling multitudes to take frequent
short pleasant excursions down the New York Bay and
along the Atlantic coast, as well as up the Hudson, and
through Long Island Sound.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p></div>

<p>Beaches that catered to a large cross-section of the
population provided a wide variety of informal
activities that replaced the established functions
found at the more select bathing resorts. For example,
the illustration of Coney Island in 1878 (<a href="#Fig5">fig. 5</a>)
shows a puppet show; pony rides for children; a
hurdy gurdy; vendors of walking sticks, sunglasses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and food; and guide ropes in the water for timid
bathers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig5" id="Fig5"></a>

<p>In the 1890s foreign visitors were impressed by
American concern with finding opportunities to play;
early in the century they had remarked on the apparent
lack of interest in amusements. The term, &#8220;summer
resorts,&#8221; no longer referred to a relatively small
number of fashionable watering places. The <i>New
York Tribune</i> was running eight columns of summer
hotel advertisements aimed directly at the middle
class. The popular <i>Summer Tourist and Excursion Guide</i>
listed moderate-priced hotels and railroad excursions;
it was a far departure from the fashionable tour of the
1840s.</p>

<p>Thus, as economic and technological factors
changed, bathing was transformed from a medicinal
treatment for the leisure class to a recreation enjoyed
by a large portion of the population.</p>

<h3>SWIMMING</h3>

<p>As has been stated earlier, swimming was being
practiced by men in Europe when the early colonists
were leaving their old homes. Nevertheless, the task
of establishing new homes left them little time to
practice the &#8220;art of swimming&#8221; or to teach it to
fellow colonists.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin is no doubt the most famous
early proponent of swimming in the colonies. In his
autobiography written in the form of a letter to his
son in 1771, Franklin revealed his early interest in
swimming.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I had from a child been delighted with this exercise, had
studied and practiced Th&eacute;venot&#8217;s motions and position,
and added some of my own, aiming at the graceful and
easy, as well as the useful.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>Benjamin Franklin used every opportunity to
encourage his friends to learn to swim,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>as I wish all men were taught to do in their youth; they
would, on many occurrences, be the safer for having that
skill, and on many more the happier, as freer from painful
apprehensions of danger, to say nothing of the enjoyment
in so delightful and wholesome an exercise.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a
href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p></div>

<p>Not only was Franklin in favor of being able to swim
but when requested he advised friends on methods
for how to teach oneself. His instructions, in his letter
of September 28, 1776 to Mr. Oliver Neale, were
published a number of times even as late as the 1830s.</p>

<p>America&#8217;s first swimming school was established at
Boston in 1827 by Francis Liefer. Two expert swimmers,
John Quincy Adams and John James Audubon,
the ornithologist, visited the school and each expressed
delight at having found such an establishment.</p>

<p>Numerous books instructing men how to swim were
brought into the United States in the early 19th
century and some were republished here, but the
first original work (i.e., not a plagiarism) by an
American was not published until 1846. In this book
the author, James Arlington Bennet, M.D., LL.D.,
based his instructions upon his own personal observations
as an experienced swimmer. Dr. Bennet&#8217;s
publication requires special note not only due to the
basic value of the information but because of the
extraordinary title (i.e., <i>The Art of Swimming Exemplified
by Diagrams from Which Both Sexes May Learn
to Swim and Float on the Water; and Rules for All Kinds
of Bathing in the Preservation of Health and Cure of
Disease, with the Management of Diet from Infancy to Old
Age, and a Valuable Remedy Against Sea-sickness</i>). Thanks
to this explicit title we learn that Dr. Bennet was in
favor of women learning to swim. This energetic
aquatic activity had long been considered a masculine
skill and, despite such a significant publication, this
attitude continued until much later in the century.</p>

<p>We have already noted in a previous discussion that
the Berkeley Springs bath houses of the 1850s provided
a swimming bath for men but no similar
facilities for women. Also at certain seaside resorts
of the same period, a special time was set for men to
practice the art of swimming without clothing, but
women had no similar opportunity. When the ladies
entered the water they were clothed from head to toe
because men were also present. The description of
women&#8217;s bathing costume, which will appear in a
later section, clearly shows that women could do
little more than try to maintain their footing. Undoubtedly
some &#8220;brazen&#8221; women did find the opportunity
to swim, but the general attitude was that
women should only immerse themselves in water.</p>

<p>By the 1860s there was a widespread health
movement which gave additional momentum to the
belief that physical exercise was good for one&#8217;s
well-being. As a result, women were being encouraged
to emerge from their state of physical inactivity
imposed by social custom. Swimming had already
gained recognition as a healthful exercise for men,
but with this fresh approach it was even being
suggested that women should swim. A column that
appeared in 1866, entitled &#8220;Physical Exercise for
Females,&#8221; asserted that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Bathing, as it is practiced at our coast resorts, is, no doubt,
a delightful recreation; but if to it swimming could be
added, the delight would be increased, and the possible
use and advantage much extended.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p></div>

<p>In answer to the possible objection that the facilities
for teaching were not always available, the writer
maintained that in addition to the seashore there
were rivers, lakes, and ponds as well as the swimming
baths found in most large cities. He further asserted
that if the demand were great enough, certain days
could be appropriated exclusively to women as
was done in some of the London baths.</p>

<p>The type of baths referred to in this case were not
built simply to supply a health-giving treatment or
for recreation as described earlier. As part of the
health movement mentioned above, there was a
growing concern in regards to personal cleansing;
it was realized that merely splashing water on the
face in the morning was not sufficient for good personal
hygiene. While facilities for washing the whole body
were being installed in wealthy homes, there was also
a growing concern for the masses of people who
could not afford such extravagance. Thus philanthropic
individuals encouraged the building of
public swimming baths in densely populated, low
income areas. It was hoped that, although the patrons
would be covered by bathing costume and would be
seeking refreshment and recreation, this unaccustomed
contact with water would improve their personal
hygiene.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>In 1870 a reporter for <i>Leslie&#8217;s</i>, who was describing
two elegant large bathhouses (the type described
above) in New York City, stated that Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays were set apart for ladies
and Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays for gentlemen.
These baths became quite popular in the large
cities, particularly among people who could not
afford the time or money to make trips even to the
near seaside resorts. By the 1880s they were so popular
that bathing time was scheduled to allow many sets
of bathers to enjoy the water. Thus a number of
women who had probably never been completely
covered with water before had the opportunity to
learn to swim.</p>

<p>While women were being encouraged to practice
swimming as a healthful exercise, this activity was
being recognized as a recreation and sport for men.
The increasing affluence during the last three decades
of the 19th century, which made possible the widespread
popularity of summer excursions, encouraged
swimming as an individual pastime as well as a
growing spectator sport. This was true not only for
swimming but for nearly every sport we enjoy today.
In 1871 a reporter wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is not underrating the interest attached to yachting or
rowing matches, to say that swimming clubs and swimming
matches can be made to create wider and more
useful emulation among &#8220;the Million&#8221; who can never
participate in or benefit by those notable trials of skill
and muscle.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p></div>

<p>By the 1890s this growing interest in spectator and
individual sports evidenced several interesting results.
Separate sporting pages were established in the formats
of many newspapers. In addition to being a summer
pastime, &#8220;the art of swimming&#8221; became an intercollegiate
and Olympic sport, and was included on
the roster of events for the 1896 revival of the Olympic
Games held in Athens. Innovations in facilities and
techniques helped to alter the character of swimming.
The most notable of these were the development of
the indoor pool and the introductions of the crawl
stroke into the United States.</p>

<p>It was in this time period that swimming for women
was becoming socially acceptable. In 1888, Goucher
College, a prominent girls&#8217; school, built its own indoor
pool and the following year swimming was listed in
its catalog for the first time. Writers, in turn, no longer
felt it necessary to convince readers that women should
be more active in the water, but concentrated instead
on what a woman should know when she swims. This
changing attitude gained world-wide recognition in
1912 at Stockholm when the 100-meter swimming
event for women was included in the schedule.</p>

<p>The period of prosperity following World War I
brought a marked increase in the appreciation of
recreation, resulting in an increase of swimming pools
and available beaches. Indoor pools, which made
swimming a year-round activity, were becoming even
more numerous than beaches. Swimming was now
established as a sport and a recreation for both men
and women. According to a 1924 magazine article in
the <i>Delineator</i>, seldom was a swimming meet held
anywhere in the country without events for women.
At Palm Beach, however, one of the few remaining
citadels of &#8220;high society,&#8221; an axiom of fashion dictated
that a lady or gentleman not go into the water before
11:45 in the morning; should one do so, one ran the
risk of being taken for a maid or valet. The masses,
however, swam for pleasure without regard to the
inhibitions of high fashion.</p>

<p>This period was also marked by the advent of
swimming personalities of both sexes. Johnny Weissmuller
became a popular hero for his accomplishments
in competitive swimming from 1921 to 1929.
Even before the war Annette Kellerman, star of
vaudeville and movies, had become famous for her
fancy diving as well as her celebrated figure, which
she daringly exhibited in a form-fitting, one-piece
suit. In addition to writing an autobiography, she
authored articles and a swimming instruction book
for women. As an example of what exercise, including
swimming, could do for women, Annette Kellerman
also lent her name to a course of physical culture
for less &#8220;well-developed&#8221; ladies. Another product
of this new age of recreation was Gertrude Ederle,
who learned to swim at the Woman&#8217;s Swimming
Association of New York. She rose to sudden fame
in 1926 as the first woman to swim the English Channel.</p>

<p>As previously stated, swimming was practiced
through the Middle Ages as a useful skill for men.
Gradually this activity became regarded as also
a healthful exercise and then as a recreation. Finally
by the late 19th century swimming also had achieved
the status of a competitive sport&mdash;but for men only.
It was not until the 1920s that social attitudes permitted
women the same full use of the water as men.</p>

<p>The restrictive attitudes defining women&#8217;s proper
behavior in the water prior to the 1920s were one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
element of the mores defining women&#8217;s participation
in society. Thus as more liberal attitudes gained
acceptance and modified the original concept of
the &#8220;weaker sex,&#8221; women gradually achieved social
acceptance of their full participation in aquatic
activities.</p>

<hr class="c25" />
<h2>Bathing Costume</h2>

<p>Bathing became popular as a medicinal treatment
for both men and women of the new world in the last
half of the 18th century. It was the only aquatic
activity, however, that was considered proper for
women until over a hundred years later.</p>

<p>Like so many other customs, changes in bathing
costume styles were initially introduced by way of
England. They were adapted or rejected according
to the special conditions of this continent. To give a
clearer picture of the costume worn in the colonies
and in the United States, descriptions of the English
dress will be included where pertinent. I have not,
however, found any evidence showing that bathing
nude was a practice for women in this country.</p>

<h3>THE EARLY BATHING GOWN</h3>

<p>It is disappointing but not surprising to discover
the lack of descriptions pertaining to early bathing
costume. This simple gown was utilitarian, not
decorative. Thus it deserved little attention in the
eyes of the contemporary bather.</p>

<p>No doubt it is due to the importance of the original
owner that the following example has survived. In
the collection of family memorabilia at Mount
Vernon, there is a chemise-type bathing gown that
is said to have been worn by Martha Washington
(<a href="#Fig6">fig. 6</a>). According to a note attached to the gown
signed by Eliza Parke Custis, and addressed to
&#8220;Rosebud,&#8221; a pet name for her daughter, Martha
Washington probably wore this bathing gown at
Berkeley Springs as she accompanied her daughter,
Patsy, in her bath.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><a name="Fig6" id="Fig6"></a>

<p class="caption">Figure 6.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Linen bathing gown</span> said to have been
worn by Martha Washington. (<i>Courtesy of The
Mount Vernon Ladies&#8217; Association.</i>)</p></div>

<p>This blue and white checked linen gown has
several construction details similar to the chemise, a
woman&#8217;s undergarment, of the period. The sleeves
were gathered near the shoulder and were set in
with a gusset at the armpit. The skirt of the gown was
made wider at the bottom by the usual method of
adding four long triangular pieces&mdash;one to each side
of both the front and back. The sleeves, however, are
not as full as those one would expect to find on a
chemise of the period. Also a chemise would probably
have had a much wider neckline gathered by a
draw-string threaded through a band at the neck
edge. Instead, this bathing gown has a moderately
low neckline made wider by a slit down the front
which is closed by two linen tapes sewn to either
edge of the front. Although less fabric was used for
the bathing gown than was normally required to
make a chemise, it was probably not because of
functional considerations as one might like to think,
but because of the scarcity of fabric. Close examination
reveals that the triangular sections of fabric
used to add fullness to the skirt consist of several
pieces. In fact the two sections used in the back are
made from a different fabric, although it is still a
blue and white checked linen. Frugal use of scraps in
linings and hidden sections of decorative costume was
common practice in the 18th century. The piecing
of the bathing gown is further evidence of the fact
that it was a garment that had no ornamental purpose.</p>

<p>Of particular interest are the lead disks which are
wrapped in linen and attached near the hem next
to the side seams by means of patches. No doubt
these weights were used to keep the gown in place
when the bather entered the water.</p>

<p>The following account of bathing in Dover, England,
in 1782 suggests how the bathing gown might have
been used at Berkeley Springs:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>The
Ladies in a morning when they intend to bathe, put
on a long flannel gown under their other clothes, walk
down to the beach, undress themselves to the flannel,
then they walk in as deep as they please, and lay hold of
the guides&#8217; hands, three or four together sometimes.</p>

<p>Then they dip over head twenty times perhaps; then
they come onto the shore where there are women that
attend with towels, cloaks, chairs, etc. The flannel is
stripp&#8217;d off, wip&#8217;d dry, etc. Women hold cloaks round
them. They dress themselves and go home.<a name="FNanchor_27"
id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p></div>

<p>The earliest illustration showing costume worn in
the United States for fresh water bathing is dated
1810 (see <a href="#Fig2">fig. 2</a>). Unfortunately the painting reveals
only that the bathing gowns were long and dark
colored in comparison with the white dresses of the
period.</p>

<p>An 1848 article which described, in detail, the
fashionable dress called for by each activity at summer
resorts, concludes with the following tantalizing
paragraph:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We have no space for an extended description of suitable
bathing-dresses. They may be procured at any of our
town establishments for the purpose. Much depends upon
individual taste in their arrangement, for uncouth as they
often of necessity are, they can be improved by a little
tact.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p></div>

<p>This is the only reference to American bathing costume
of the second quarter of the 19th century that the
author has found at this time. Nevertheless, an
English source describes what must have been a
transitional style between the chemise-type bathing
gown and the more fitted costume of the 1850s.</p>

<p>The <i>Workwoman&#8217;s Guide</i>, published in London,
1840, included instructions for making both a bathing
gown and a bathing cap. Health and modesty were
the main considerations that influenced the choice
of color and type of material.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Bathing gowns are made of blue or white flannel, stuff,
calimanco, or blue linen. As it is especially desirable that
the water should have free access to the person, and yet
that the dress should not cling to, or weigh down the
bather, stuff or calimanco are preferred to most other
materials; the dark coloured gowns are the best for
several reasons, but chiefly because they do not show the
figure, and make the bather less conspicuous than she
would be in a white dress.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p></div>

<p>The following details reveal that, in general, this
1840 bathing gown starts as an unshaped garment
similar to the gown attributed to Martha Washington
[brackets are mine].</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As the width of the materials, of which a bathing gown
is made, varies, it is impossible to say of how many
breadths it should consist. The width at the bottom, when
the gown is doubled, should be about 15 nails [1 nail = 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>
in.]: fold it like a pinafore, slope 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> nails for the
shoulders, cut or open slits of 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> nails long for the armholes,
set in plain sleeves 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> nails long, 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> nails wide,
and make a slit in front 5 nails long.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30"
class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p></div>

<p>The instructions for finishing this gown, however,
show that the sleeves were worn close around the
wrists and that the fullness of the skirt was secured
at the waist by a belt.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In making up, delicacy is the great object to be attended
to. Hem the gown at the bottom, gather it into a band
at the top, and run in strings; hem the opening and the
bottom of the sleeves and put in strings. A broad band
should be sewed in about half a yard from the top, to
button round the waist.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p></div>

<p>By the addition of the above details this type of
bathing gown more closely approximates the style
of the long-skirted blouse of the 1850s to be described
later.</p>

<p>In regard to the bathing cap we are told that,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>These are made of oil-silk, and are worn, when bathing,
by ladies who have long hair.... It is advisable, however,
for those who have not long hair, to bathe in plain
linen caps, so as to admit the water without the sand or
grit, and thus the bather, unless prohibited on account
of health, enjoys all the benefit of the shock without
injuring the hair.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p></div>

<p>The &#8220;Scene at Cape May&#8221; (<a href="#Fig3">fig. 3</a>) shows women
wearing long-skirted, long-sleeved, belted gowns as
well as head coverings similar to the type described
in <i>The Workwoman&#8217;s Guide</i>.</p>

<p>Thus during the period when bathing became
popular as a medicinal treatment, women wore loose,
open gowns perhaps patterned after a common undergarment,
the chemise. Although this chemise-type
bathing costume must have been very comfortable
when dry, its fullness was restrictive when wet. The
bather could only immerse herself in water which was
all that was necessary for the treatment. As the
recreational possibilities of bathing began to overshadow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
its health-giving properties, women&#8217;s bathing
dresses also became more fitted, following the general
silhouette of women&#8217;s fashions.</p>

<h3>BIFURCATED BATHING DRESS</h3>

<p>During the first half of the 19th century in England
and the United States, a more tolerant attitude toward
feminine exercise led women to abandon the fiction
that they were not bipedal while bathing. This
acknowledgment, however, was not fostered solely
by the need for a more functional bathing dress. It
was first evidenced by a few daring European women
who wore lace-edged pantaloons trimmed with several
rows of tucking under their daytime dresses. The
shorter, untrimmed, knee-length drawers which
quickly replaced the pantaloons, became an unseen
but essential item in the fashionable English lady&#8217;s
toilette of the 1840s. These drawers, or a plainer
version of the longer pantaloons, were adapted not
only to the female riding habit but the bathing dress
as well. An 1828 English source reported that &#8220;Many
ladies when riding wear silk drawers similar to what
is worn when bathing.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33"
class="fnanchor">[33]</a> With the increased interest
in physical exercise for women, ankle-length, open
pantaloons also were being worn in the 1840s with a
long overdress as an early form of gymnasium suit.
This evidence of the early use of drawers suggests that,
like English ladies, women in the United States were
probably wearing a type of drawers beneath their
nondescript bathing gowns during the second quarter
of the 19th century. There is some slight support of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
this theory in the following stanza of a poem that
appeared in 1845:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But go to the beach ere the morning be ended<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And look at the bathers&mdash;oh what an array<br /></span>

<span class="i0">E&#8217;en red flannel shirts are the &#8220;go&#8221; at Cape May.<a name="FNanchor_34"
id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The rather crude but delightful sketch of seabathing
at Coney Island in 1856 (<a href="#Fig7">fig. 7</a>) shows the
ladies wearing very full, ankle-length, trousers with
a sack top extending loosely only a few inches below
the waist. This type of bathing costume, which was
primarily a bifurcated garment instead of a skirted
one, became the prevailing fashion as reported in
English women&#8217;s magazines of the 1860s.</p>

Leslie&#8217;s Illustrated Newspaper</i>, September 1856.<br />
(Smithsonian photo 58437.)</p></div>

<p>In contrast to the originally European skirtless
costume, the Philadelphia publication, <i>Peterson&#8217;s
Magazine</i>, stated that bathing dress should consist
of a pair of drawers and a long-skirted dress. The
recommended drawers were full and confined at
the ankle by a band that was finished with a ruffle.
These drawers were attached to a &#8220;body&#8221; and
fastened so that, even if the skirt washed up, the
individual could not possibly be exposed. The dress
was made by pleating or gathering the desired
length of material onto a deep yoke with a separate
belt securing the fullness at the waist. The bottom
of the hem was about three inches above the ankle
and was considered rather short. Loose shirt sleeves
were drawn around the wrist by a band which was
finished with a deep ruffle as a protection against
the sun. According to this article many women wore
a small talma or cape which hid the figure to some
extent. It was recommended that the drawers, dress,
and talma be made of the same woolen material.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Bathing-dresses, although generally very unbecoming can
be made to look very prettily with a little taste. If the
dress is of a plain color, such as grey, blue or brown, a
trimming around the talma, collar, yoke, ruffles etc ...,
of crimson, green or scarlet, is a great addition.<a name="FNanchor_35"
id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p></div>

<p>To complete a bathing toilette the following items
were considered necessary: a pair of large lisle thread
gloves, an oil cap to protect the hair from the water,
a straw hat to shield the face from the sun, and gum
overshoes for tender feet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><a name="Fig8" id="Fig8"></a>

<p class="caption">Figure 8.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bathing dress</span>, c. 1855. (<i>Courtesy of Philadelphia

<p>The red, tan, and blue-green checked bathing dress
shown in  <a href="#Fig8">figure 8</a> is jauntily trimmed with crimson
braid edging the collar, belt, and wrist and ankle
bands. This costume is a variation of the style described
previously. The drawers, unlike those described<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
in <i>Peterson&#8217;s Magazine</i>, are sewn to a linen band
with linen suspenders attached. The unfitted, unshaped
skirt (8 ft. 8 in. in circumference) is pulled in
at the waist by a belt attached to the center back. A
similar technique for forming a waistline is described
in <i>The Workwoman&#8217;s Guide</i> of 1840.</p>

<p>Women&#8217;s magazines in the United States from the
third quarter of the 19th century show illustrations of
bathing costume, but in many instances these publications
used European fashion plates. <i>Harper&#8217;s Bazar</i>,
(spelled thus until 1929) particularly in its early years,
used fashion plates and pattern supplements from its
German predecessor <i>Der Bazar</i>. Thus, in one issue
one can find a fashion plate showing the predominantly
bifurcated European bathing suit and, in a column on
New York fashions, a separate description of long-skirted
bathing dresses with trousers. During the same
period <i>Peterson&#8217;s Magazine</i> had illustrations previously
used in the London publication, <i>Queen&#8217;s Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>American women seem to have accepted the majority
of styles shown in European fashion plates,
except for the skirtless bathing suits. The writer of an
1868 column on New York fashions sought to convince
his readers to try the more daring European style
although he grudgingly admitted that the &#8220;Bathing
suits made with trousers and blouse waist without
skirt are objected to by many ladies as masculine and
fast....&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36"
class="fnanchor">[36]</a> This style was in fact, very similar to
the costume worn by men when they bathed with the
ladies. A year later, the writer of the same fashion
column had given up the campaign to dress all women
in the skirtless suits and admitted that these imports
&#8220;... are worn by expert swimmers, who do not
wish to be encumbered with bulky clothing.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_37"
id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Such
practical bathing dress was thus limited to a very
small number of progressive women.</p>

<p>The majority, consisting of those who were strictly
bathers, wore the ankle-length drawers beneath a
long dress as described or illustrated in the majority
of sources that originated in the United States. Why
was the European bathing suit not fully adopted by
American women? Differences between the bathing
customs of the two continents undoubtedly encouraged
the development of different dress. While men and
women in the United States bathed together freely
at the seashore during the latter half of the 19th
century, this practice was not widely accepted in
England until the early 1900s. In the presence of men,
American women probably felt compelled to retain
their more concealing dress and drawers.</p>

<p>In England swimming seems to have been more
popular among women than it was in the United
States. While encouraging its readers to swim, during
the late 1860s, <i>Queen&#8217;s Magazine</i> used forceful language
of a kind that was not found in American publications
until the late 19th century. If swimming was more
acceptable as a feminine exercise in England it is
understandable why English women were more
receptive to a functional, skirtless bathing suit&mdash;especially
since it was worn only in the presence of
other women.</p>

<p>In 1858, Winslow Homer, who was later to become
a well-known American painter, was welcomed
into the society at Newport until it became apparent
that he wanted to sketch the bathers for a weekly
newspaper (see <a href="#Fig4">fig. 4</a>). So great were the ensuing
objections that he was permitted to complete his
sketches &#8220;... provided he depicted the bathers
only in the water and only above the waistline and
without divulging the identity of the bathers.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_38"
id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>As can be seen in  <a href="#Fig4">figure 4</a>, these sketches serve more
as a testament of Homer&#8217;s fancy than as an accurate
historical statement on style. The two feminine
legs exposed in the water from just below the knee
to the toe and the feminine head coverings appear
to be anachronisms. According to several other
illustrations of the period, these women were undoubtedly
wearing long drawers. The young artist
at 22, however, has been described as having an eye
for feminine beauty and a sense of fashion. He seems
to have exploited to the full the decorative possibilities
of hoop skirts blown by the breeze or agitated by some
pretty accident to discreetly reveal a trim ankle.
A drama of breeze versus long skirt appears with the
small feminine figure in the left background of this
print. The force of the waves and the motion of the
frolicking bathers gave the artist opportunity to show
two more pretty accidents. The only head covering
he showed for feminine bathers was a ruffled cap that
framed the face. Other sources show Newport bathers
wearing the less attractive wide-brimmed straw hat
(<a href="#Fig9">fig. 9</a>). The straw headgear worn over these caps
seems more likely since Newport&#8217;s fashionable belles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
would surely have sacrificed appearances and worn a
straw hat to avoid an unfashionable sunburn and tan.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 9.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bathing hat</span> of natural color and purple
straw, c. 1880. (Smithsonian photo P-65409.)</p></div>

<p>Nevertheless, Homer&#8217;s sketch reflects characteristics
seen in certain surviving examples from the 1860s&mdash;namely
that the top was becoming more fitted, being
attached completely to a belt with the fuller skirt
pleated or gathered to the bottom edge of the belt.
In the Design Laboratory Collection of the Brooklyn
Museum there is an 1860 black poplin specimen that
may be a bathing dress. This example is trimmed
at the shoulder seam with epaulets, an example of the
extent to which fashion was finally playing a part in
bathing costume.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The dresses described above appear peculiar not
only to 20th century eyes, but they also seem to have
amused mid-19th century correspondents. One writer
in 1857 declared that,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We don&#8217;t think a man could identify his own wife when
she comes out of the bathing-house. A plump figure enters,
surrounded with a multitude of rustly flounces and
scarcely able to squeeze an enormous hoop through the
door. She is absent a few minutes, and presto change!
out comes a tall lank apparition, wrapped in the scanty
folds of something that looks more like a superannuated
night-gown than anything else, and a battered straw-chapeau
knocked down over the eyes, and stalks down
towards the beach with the air and gait of a Tartar
chieftain!<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>

<p>Another writer felt that he</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>... must say&mdash;even in the columns of <i>Frank Leslie&#8217;s
Illustrated</i>&mdash;that they don&#8217;t look very picturesque or pretty
when <i>a la Naiade</i>.... Rather limp, sacks tied in the
middle, eel-bottles, hydropathic coalheavers and &#8220;longshoremen,&#8221;
and preternaturally dilapidated Bloomers,
would appear to be the ideals aimed at.<a name="FNanchor_41"
id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
[<a href="#Fig11">fig. 11</a>.]</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><a name="Fig11" id="Fig11"></a>

<p class="caption">Figure 11.&mdash;&#8220;<span class="smcap">How she came out</span>,&#8221; from <i>Harper&#8217;s
Bazar</i>, August 1870. (Smithsonian photo 61585B.)</p></div>

<p>This use of the term &#8220;Bloomers,&#8221; referring to long full
drawers or trousers, is a reminder of how similar the
1855 bathing gown with drawers (see <a href="#Fig8">fig. 8</a>) was
to the reform dress introduced in 1848 and worn by
Amelia Bloomer, the feminist, in 1852.</p>

<p>Despite the evident use of a new waistline treatment,
the most popular bathing costume of the
1870s, according to <i>Harper&#8217;s Bazar</i>, continued to
feature the yoke blouse that reached at least to the
knee. This combination of blouse and skirt was held
in position at the waist by a belt. The high neck was
finished with a sailor collar or a standing pleated
frill, while the long sleeves and full Turkish trousers,
buttoned on the side of the ankle, concealed the
limbs. In 1873 a column on New York fashions
reported an effort to popularize short-sleeved, low-throated
suits then in favor at European bathing
places and which had been illustrated in the <i>Bazar</i>.
Nevertheless, the writer hedged this report by adding
that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is thought best, however, to provide an extra pair of
long sleeves that may be buttoned on or basted in the
short puffs that are sewn in the arm holes. Sometimes a
small cape fastening closely about the throat is also
added.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p></div>

<p>Nevertheless, sketches of bathing scenes from the
seventies indicate that some American women wore
even shorter sleeves and trousers than those prescribed
by the fashion magazines.</p>

<p>Linen and wool fabrics were both suggested in the
1840s, but by the 1870s flannel was most frequently
used for bathing dresses, with serge also being recommended.
Navy blue, and to a lesser extent, white,
gray, scarlet, and brown were popular colors in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
checks as well as solid colors trimmed with white,
red, gray, or blue worsted braid.</p>

<p>Bathing mantles or cloaks were worn to conceal
the moist figure when crossing the beach. These
garments were made of Turkish toweling with wide
sleeves and hoods, and were so long as &#8220;to barely
escape&#8221; the ground.</p>

<p>In 1873 one good bathing cap was described as an
oiled silk bag-crown cap large enough to hold the hair
loosely. The frill around the edge was bound with
colored braid. Many ladies preferred, however, to
let their hair hang loose and under a wide-brimmed
hat of coarse straw tied down on the sides to protect
their skin from the sun (<a href="#Fig9">fig. 9</a>).</p>

<p>Bathing shoes or slippers were generally worn when
the shore was rough and uneven. In 1871 manila
sandals were worn, but the most functional bathing
shoes are said to have been high buskins of thick
unbleached cotton duck with cork soles. They were
secured with checked worsted braid. Two years later
there were bathing shoes of white duck or sail canvas
with manila soles. Slippers for walking in the sand
were &#8220;mules&#8221; or merely toes and soles made of
flannel, braided to match the cloak, and sewn to
cork soles.</p>

<p>Throughout this period the social aspect of bathing
predominated over the therapeutic goals and women
were making a greater effort to transform their bathing
garments into attractive and functional outfits.
Motivated by the presence of men at the seashore and
by the competition with other women for masculine
attention, ladies were more concerned with the style
of their bathing dresses and appropriate trimmings.
Thus bathing costume joined the ranks of other
fashions described in women&#8217;s magazines.</p>

<p>Now that women were frolicking in the water
rather than simply being dunked several times,
their costume became somewhat more functional.
Long trousers gave them greater freedom in the water
although the skirts which continued to be worn,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
tended to negate this improvement. Even as early as
the 1870s there were efforts to shorten sleeves and
eliminate high necklines. This trend to make bathing
dress more practical increased in momentum toward
the end of the century.</p>

<h3>PRINCESS STYLE BATHING DRESS</h3>

<p>Although attitudes toward sports were more enlightened
by the 1880s, many women continued to
wear the old bathing dress with its belted blouse
extending to a long skirt and a pair of trousers. As an
alternate to this garb, the &#8220;princess style&#8221; was developed
with the blouse and trousers cut in one piece or
else sewn permanently to the same belt. A separate
skirt extending below the knee was buttoned at the
waist to conceal the figure. This new style in bathing
costume was probably derived from an innovation in
women&#8217;s underwear. During the late 1870s a new
style of undergarment, the &#8220;combination&#8221; of chemise
and drawers, had come into use. Petticoats could be
fastened to buttons sewn around the waist of the
combination. This streamlining of undergarments
helped the lady of fashion to maintain a desirably
svelte figure. Apparently the advantages of this
streamlining were obvious, because it was not long
before women were quietly adapting this style to
bathing dresses. By the 1890s the skirt was often
omitted for swimming (<a href="#Fig12">fig. 12</a>), giving the more
active women more freedom in the water. Following
popular dress styles, the top of the bathing costume
was bloused over the belt. The sailor collar, either
large or small, was a great favorite, but a straight
standing collar with rows of white braid was also worn.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig12" id="Fig12"></a>
<img src="images/illo44.png" alt="Display of Fashionable Bathing Costumes" width="500" height="326" />
<p class="caption">Figure 12.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bathing costumes</span> from a supplement to <i>The
Tailor&#8217;s Review</i>, July 1895.<br />
(<i>Courtesy of Library of Congress.</i>)</p></div>

<p>The &#8220;princess style&#8221; was not the only innovation
available in bathing dress. <i>Harper&#8217;s Bazar</i> reported in
1881 that imported French bathing suits<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a
href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> for ladies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
were made without sleeves, since any covering on the
arm interfered with the freedom desirable for swimming.
Nevertheless, according to other contemporary
fashion descriptions, American bathing suits retained
their long sleeves until the early 1880s when the
foreign fashion of short sleeves came to the United
States. In 1885 it was reported that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The sleeves may be the merest &#8216;caps&#8217; four or five inches
deep under the arm, curved narrow toward the top, and
lapped there or they may be half-long and straight,
reaching to the elbows, or else they may be the regular
coat sleeves covering the arms to the wrist. With the short
sleeves it is customary to add the sleeves cut from a gauze
vest to give the arm some protection from the sun.<a name="FNanchor_44"
id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p></div>

<p>Sleeves were pushed up in 1890 and puffed high about
the shoulders by means of elastic tape in the hem. By
1893 fashion reports acknowledged that sleeve length
was a matter of individual choice.</p>

<p>Despite this neat resolution of the diminishing
sleeve, contemporary sketches of bathing scenes
indicate that some women in the United States were
wearing the shorter sleeves even earlier.</p>

<p>Short full trousers, reaching just below the knee,
accompanied by knee-length skirts&mdash;sometimes worn
even shorter&mdash;succeeded the long Turkish trousers
and ankle-length skirt. As the trousers diminished in
length, long stockings or bathing shoes with long
stocking tops became a necessary part of the bathing
costume to cover the lower limbs, particularly in
mixed bathing (see <a href="#Fig1">fig. 1</a>). The stockings, which were
cotton or wool, plain or fancy, and of any color or
combination of colors in keeping with the costume,
were worn with a variety of bathing shoes, sandals, or
slippers when bathing off a rocky shore. Foot coverings
were usually made of white canvas; the slippers
were held on by a spiral arrangement of braid or
ribbon about the ankles, while the laced shoes were
often made with heavy cork soles. A gaiter shoe or
combination shoe and stocking was made of waterproof
cloth, laced up the sides, and reached to about
the knees. Low rubber shoes were also worn.</p>

<p>Bathing caps of waxed linen or oiled silk were used
to protect the hair. They had whale bone in the brim
and could be adjusted by drawstrings in the back.
Blue, white, or ecru rubber hats were also used. These
caps had large full crowns&mdash;which held in all the
hair&mdash;and wired brims. A wide-brimmed rough straw
hat, tied on with a strip of trimming braid or with
ribbon, was sometimes worn as protection against
the sun (<a href="#Fig9">fig. 9</a>).</p>

<p>Bathing mantles like those of the 1870s were still
being worn by the late 19th century and these were
frequently trimmed with colored braid. Cotton tapes
sewn in parallel rows, mohair braid, or strips of
flannel were still being used to make the bathing
dress more attractive.</p>

<p>Navy blue and white, as well as ecru, maroon, gray,
and olive were popular colors for the bathing dress.
In 1890 the writer of a fashion column thought it
pertinent to add that &#8220;... black bathing suits are
worn as a matter of choice, not merely by those
dressing in mourning.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a
href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Apparently the wearing of
black no longer had this exclusive significance when
bathing, but prior to 1890 it did.</p>

<p>As women became more active in the water and
were learning to swim they began to accept more
practical changes in bathing costume. Not only the
style, as described previously, but also the fabric was
considered for its functional characteristics. Flannel
was still widely used but was being replaced by serge
which was not as heavy when wet. Another indication
of this trend was that stockinet, a knitted material,
was gaining in popularity at the end of the century.</p>

<p>The &#8220;princess style&#8221; of the early 1890s combined
the drawers and bodice in one garment: the separate
skirt fell just short of the ends of the drawers which
covered the knees. By the mid-1890s, however, the
drawers which were now called knickerbockers, were
shortened so as to be completely covered by the knee-length
skirt. These knickerbockers were either attached
to the waist in the popular &#8220;princess style&#8221; or they
were fastened to the waist by a series of flat bone
buttons.</p>

<p>During this same period, the mid-1890s, knitted,
cotton tights were sometimes worn in place of
knickerbockers. Bathing tights differed from the
knickerbockers in that they were hemmed rather
than gathered on an elastic band at the lower edge
and that they were not attached to the waist. When
tights were used they were completely concealed
by a one-piece, knee-length bathing dress. The use
of the more streamlined bathing tights was another
step toward more functional bathing costume.
Despite these improvements, most women continued
to wear stockings, usually black, when they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
bathed or swam in public. The dictates of fashion
and standards of modesty continued to conflict with
practical considerations.</p>

<p>As with street dress, corsets seem to have been an
important though unseen bathing article necessary
for maintaining smart posture. In 1896 it was reported
that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Unless a woman is very slender, bathing corsets should be
worn. If they are not laced tightly they are a help instead
of a hindrance to swimming, and some support is needed
for a figure that is accustomed to wearing stays.<a name="FNanchor_46"
id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p></div>

<p>While describing the bathing dresses available in
1910 an article noted: &#8220;Some of these are made up
with ... princess forms that are boned so as to do
away with the bathing corset.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>The bodice of the bathing costume continued to
be bloused, but by 1905 it was modified to be merely
loose. An article appearing in 1896 noted that bathing
suits should be cut high in the neck, not tight around
the throat, but close enough to prevent burning by
the sun. The sailor collar continued to be used during
the late 1890s but became less fashionable shortly
after the turn of the century. Nevertheless there had
to be some white around the neck for the bathing
dress to be considered smart. The puffed sleeves,
which had become popular in the late 1890s were
modified in breadth and length to allow free use of
the muscles in swimming (<a href="#Fig13">fig. 13</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><a name="Fig13" id="Fig13"></a>

<p class="caption">Figure 13.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bathing dress of black &#8220;mohair,&#8221;</span>
c. 1900. (Smithsonian photo 60383.)</p></div>

<p>In 1897 fashion magazines were suggesting that
skirts of bathing dresses looked best when the front
breadth was shaped narrower toward the belt,
while by 1902 the skirts were fitted over the hips in
order to delineate the figure. In 1905 pleated skirts
again became fashionable, although flared skirts
were still acceptable.</p>

<p>Dark blue and black were the popular colors,
although white, red, gray, and green were also used.
Flannel was no longer recommended for bathing
dress; serge and &#8220;mohair&#8221;&mdash;a fabric with a cotton
warp and a mohair or alpaca weft&mdash;were widely
used. The impractical bathing dress of silk fabric
was worn by those who could afford this extravagance;
thus, the conspicuous consumption of the &#8220;leisure
class&#8221; was even found at the beaches.</p>

<p>Bathing hats were still being worn but it was
considered more fashionable to wear a rubber or
oil silk cap covered with a bright silk turban when
there was a surf. For the bather who seldom ventured
very far into the water the most fashionable practice
was to have no covering at all.</p>

<p>Throughout the 19th century bathing costume
followed an impelling course toward becoming more
functional. As the popularity of recreational bathing
and then swimming for women increased, the number
of yards of fabric required to make a bathing dress
decreased. Nevertheless, by the 1900s, many women
knew how to swim, but the majority were still bathers.
Thus bathing suits continued in use through the
first quarter of the 20th century.</p>

<h2>Swimming Costume</h2>

<p>Bathing costume did not evolve gracefully into the
swim suit, nor was there an abrupt replacement of
one garment for the other. Instead, a garb designed
for swimming emerged in the 19th century as tentatively
and as poorly received as had the suggestion
that women should be active in the water. The growing
popularity of swimming and the changing status
of women eventually made it possible for the swimming
suit to replace the bathing suit in the 1920s. By
the 1930s, however, this trend was accelerated by a
growing advertising and ready-to-wear clothing
industry. Thus a history of the swimming costume
tends to divide itself into two sections: early swimming
suits and the influence of the swim suit industry.</p>

<h3>EARLY SWIMMING SUITS</h3>

<p>The earliest reference to swimming costume I have
found was in 1869. At this date swimming in the
United States was considered a masculine skill,
exercise, and recreation; only men were provided
with a real opportunity to swim at popular watering
places. As described previously, <i>Harper&#8217;s Bazar</i>
reported that American women in general rejected
the European bathing suit made with long trousers
and a skirtless waist. Nevertheless, this costume was
&#8220;... worn by expert swimmers, who do not wish to
be encumbered with bulky clothing.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>In the 1870s the rare descriptions of this more
functional garment&mdash;called &#8220;swimming suit&#8221; even
at this early date&mdash;were limited to a sentence or two
buried within long columns of fine print describing
popular bathing apparel. One mentions a &#8220;...
single knitted worsted garment, fitting the figure, with
waist and trousers in one.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a
href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Another was made without
sleeves as &#8220;one garment, the blouse and trousers
being cut all in one, like the sleeping garments worn
by small children.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a
href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> These more practical bifurcated
garments probably derived from the European suit
of the 1860s that had been rejected by the majority of
American women. For example, an English source
reported that in 1866 the following garment was
worn: &#8220;... Swimming Costume, a body and
trousers cut in one, secures perfect liberty of action
and does not expose the figure.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The descriptions of American swimming suits,
however brief, offered evidence that the pastime was
growing in popularity with women. Generally
speaking, 19th century women&#8217;s magazines were mere
disseminators of fine and decorous ideas and practices
for well-mannered ladies; their editors were not
innovators. With such an editorial policy it is understandable
that these magazines would not, as a rule,
publicize trends of popular origin until they were
fairly well established. The skirtless swimming suit of
the 1870s was no doubt more common in the United
States than its meager description in <i>Harper&#8217;s Bazar</i>
would seem to indicate.</p>

<p>As long as feminine swimming was not generally
accepted, however, efforts to develop practical swimming
suits remained isolated owing to the lack of
communication between manufacturer and consumer
and to traditional attitudes. Feminine interest in
swimming and physical activities threatened belief
in the &#8220;weaker-sex&#8221; that contributed to maintaining
the traditional masculine and feminine roles; efforts
to develop functional swimming dress also attacked
established standards of feminine modesty. These
challenges to the status quo were met with the weapon
of the complacent majority&mdash;silence. Consequently,
from the third quarter of the 19th century, when we
find the first reference to a specialized garment for
swimming in the United States, writings on swimming
costume appeared infrequently until the 1920s.</p>

<p>In 1886 two &#8220;ladies&#8217; bathing jerseys&#8221; and two bathing
suits of the traditional type appeared in the <i>First
Illustrated Catalogue of Knitted Bathing Suits</i> of J. J.
Pfister Company in San Francisco. The captions
over the illustrations leave no question that the
briefer bathing jerseys were intended for swimming
while the others were for bathing. These jerseys&mdash;form-fitting
tunics that were mid-thigh in length&mdash;were
made with high necks and cap sleeves. Underneath
this garment women wore trunks that extended
to the knee and stockings; there was also the alternate
choice of tights, a combination of trunks and stockings.
To complete the outfit the feminine reader was
encouraged to buy a knitted skull cap.</p>

<p>Apparently these bathing jerseys were successful;
three, instead of two, jerseys appeared in the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
catalog in 1890. It is obvious from this later catalog,
however, that there was a greater demand for bathing
dresses since twelve designs of the skirted costume
were featured as opposed to the two dresses in the
first issue.</p>

<p>Even by the early 20th century it is difficult to find
specific references to a swimming suit in women&#8217;s
magazines; only occasionally does a concern with
swimming obtrude into the traditional descriptions of
bathing dress. In <i>The Woman&#8217;s Book of Sports</i>, however,
J. Parmly Paret was specific about the requirements
for a suitable swimming costume in 1901.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is particularly important that nothing tight should be
worn while swimming, no matter how fashionable a dress
may be for bathing. The exercise requires the greatest
freedom, and a swimming costume should never include
corsets, tight sleeves, or a skirt below the knees. The
freedom of the shoulders is the most important of all, but
anything tight around the body interferes with the
breathing and the muscles of the back, while a long skirt&mdash;even
one a few inches below the knees&mdash;binds the legs
constantly in making their strokes.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p></div>

<p>Although this costume (<a href="#Fig14">fig. 14</a>) more closely resembles
the traditional bathing dress than the jersey described
previously, this discussion illustrates the growing
dichotomy between bathing dress and swimming dress
and between fashionable styles and functional styles.</p>

Sports</i>, 1901. (Smithsonian photo 58436.)</p></div>

<p>Photographs of East coast beach scenes in 1903 show
a few women wearing costumes different from the
black or navy blue bathing dress worn by the majority.
These independent spirits seem to be wearing close-fitting
knitted trunks that cover the knees or, when
with stockings, come within an inch or two above the
knee. Above these trunks they appear to be wearing
knitted one-piece tunics or belted blouses that cover
the hips. This costume, sleeveless or short-sleeved,
and with a simplified neckline, must have been the
functional suit of its day.</p>

<p>An important impetus was given to the development
of the swimming suit with the entrance of women into
swimming as a competitive sport. On September 5,
1909, Adeline Trapp wore a one-piece knitted swimming
suit when she became the first woman to swim
across the East River in New York, through the
treacherous waters of Hell Gate. Both the swimming
suit and the swim were part of a campaign devised by
Wilbert Longfellow&mdash;of the U.S. Volunteer Life
Saving Corps&mdash;to encourage women to learn to swim.</p>

<p>Adeline Trapp was a summer employee of the Life
Saving Corps in 1909. Mr. Longfellow saw in the
20-year-old Brooklyn school teacher a respectable
young woman who could be a source of publicity.
He ordered her to get a one-piece swimming suit
for the swim. As early as 1899 in England, a woman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
participating in competitions organized by the Amateur
Swimming Association could have worn a one-piece,
skirtless, knitted costume with a shaped sleeve
at least three inches long, a slightly scooped neck,
and legs that extended to within three inches of the
knee. Mr. Longfellow may have had this English
suit in mind. He might have known of similar suits
in the United States or he might have simply wanted
to free Adeline of yards of fabric to make her more
competitive with male swimmers. Nevertheless,
Adeline Trapp did not know that the English suits
existed, nor did she know where she could find one.
She spent many hours going from one American
manufacturer to another trying on men&#8217;s knitted
suits. She found that they were all cut too low at the
neck and armholes and did not cover enough of the
legs to preclude criticism. At this point a friend who
worked for a stocking manufacturer offered to get
her a suitable costume from England. This costume,
a knitted, gray cotton suit&mdash;whether originally for a
man or woman in England is not known&mdash;was the
one Adeline wore when she swam Hell Gate.</p>

<p>Although more than thirty men attempted the
swim, the fact that a woman accomplished the feat
made newspaper headlines. Following this event,
Miss Trapp received a terse letter from the Brooklyn
School Board stating that they thought it improper
for an educator of Brooklyn children to appear in
public so scantily dressed in a one-piece swimming
costume. For her future swims Adeline Trapp was
careful to have someone carry a blanket to throw
over her as she emerged from the water.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>In 1910, Annette Kellerman arrived in the United
States from Australia by way of England. For her
fancy diving exhibitions she wore sleeveless one-piece
knitted swimming tights that covered her from
neck to toe&mdash;a costume she had probably adopted
in England.</p>

<p>The decade from 1910 to 1920 was a crucial period
in the history of bathing and swimming costume.
Popular attitudes were changing in favor of the woman
who swam but, as frequently occurs in social reforms,
there was a cultural lag between public opinion and
the policies of institutions. The Red Cross, which
began its excellent water safety program in 1914,
taught women to swim but did not admit women as
Life Saving Corps members until 1920. Symbolic of
the conflict between old and new attitudes were the
relative roles of bathing and swimming costume during
this period. As Annette Kellerman described them:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There are two kinds ... those that are adapted for use
in water, and those that are unfit for use except on dry
land. If you are going to swim, wear a water bathingsuit.
But if you are merely going to play on the beach, and
pose for the camera fiends, you may safely wear the dry
land variety.... I am certain that there isn&#8217;t a single
reason under the sun why everybody should not wear
lightweight suits. Anyone who persuades you to wear the
heavy skirty kind is endangering your life.<a name="FNanchor_54"
id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p></div>

<p>Chic women&#8217;s magazines, however, were still reluctant
to admit in their fashion pages that a more utilitarian
costume existed. The June 1, 1917 issue of
<i>Vogue</i> reported that there were two kinds of bathing
suits: a loose straight suit and those on surplice lines,
&#8220;... which hold their place by virtue of being so very
becoming.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>The most popular of these, the surplice, was not a
novelty of the season but a continuation of 19th century
bathing suit styles. Fashion illustrations show
that the hemline of the skirt was approaching the
middle of the knee, with the bloomers remaining
hidden. There was also a revival of the style that permitted
the bloomers to show several inches below the
skirt. In this case the bloomers reached the knee and
the skirt was several inches shorter. Both versions were
shown with short sleeves or cap sleeves, or sleeveless;
&#8220;<span class="lettsymb">V</span>&#8221; necklines with collars and square necklines were
widely used. The more fashionable creations were
made of silk taffeta or &#8220;surf satin,&#8221; while the majority
were made of &#8220;mohair,&#8221; wool jersey, worsted, or
closely woven cotton. Black and navy blue were unquestionably
the favorite colors.</p>

<p>The loose straight suit, which evidently gained its
inspiration from the chemise frock of the period, had
no waistline and hung straight from the shoulders
(<a href="#Fig15">fig. 15</a>); a belt or sash was frequently looped below
the natural waistline on the hips. The chemise-type of
bathing suit differed from the surplice only in having
no fitted waist and requiring less fabric.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 275px;"><a name="Fig15" id="Fig15"></a>

<p class="caption">Figure 15.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Black silk bathing dress</span>, 1923.<br />
(Smithsonian photo P-65412.)</p></div>

<p>In the June 15, 1917 issue, <i>Vogue</i> modified its
position of two weeks earlier to acknowledge that
there was a third style of costume worn in the water.
Again, the descriptions of the surplice and chemise-type
bathing suits were accompanied by numerous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
illustrations. No drawings, however, were published
to show the knitted jersey suit that was described as
&#8220;... usually sleeveless, quite short and fairly
straight ...&#8221; and &#8220;... intended for the woman
who swims expertly.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>As late as the early 1920s, the fashion pages of
<i>Harper&#8217;s Bazar</i> and <i>Vogue</i> were concentrated on the
bathing suits, aiming at readers involved in the
social life of the seaside resorts&mdash;lounging about the
beach with occasional splashing in the water. The
growing numbers of women who wanted swimming
suits, however, had only to turn to the advertising
sections of these same magazines to find that even in
1915 such shops as Bonwit Teller &amp; Co. and
B. Altman &amp; Co. were advertising knitted swimming
suits.</p>

<p>In June 1916, <i>Delineator</i> solved the dilemma of
bathing versus swimming costume in an intriguing
article written to sell a pattern for a bathing costume.
In description and presentation of illustrations, the
article emphasized a costume with &#8220;all the features
essential to a practical swimming-suit.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_57"
id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The blouse
and bloomers were attached at the waist in this
garment which had a square neckline and no skirt
or sleeves. Made up in wool jersey, this would have
been a practical swimming costume for the period.
But this was not the only style available from this
one pattern. The following variations were included:
a sailor collar on a &#8220;<span class="lettsymb">V</span>&#8221; neckline; a high-standing
collar, long sleeves; and a detachable skirt with the
fullness either pleated or gathered into a waistband,
to be worn long to the knees or just short enough to
show several inches of the bloomer. In this way
<i>Delineator</i> succeeded in satisfying nearly every degree
of conservatism&mdash;an amazing accomplishment.</p>

<p>The spring edition of <i>Sears, Roebuck and Co. Catalog</i>
for 1916 offered a one-piece, or &#8220;California-style,&#8221;
knitted worsted bathing suit with the underpiece
sewn to a skirt. This costume was less elaborate than
the other dresses shown, although it was still knee
length. The 1918 spring catalog showed two one-piece
knitted outfits suitable for swimming in striking
contrast to the surplice bathing dresses that were
also offered. By 1920 all of the bathing costumes
illustrated in the <i>Sears, Roebuck and Co. Catalog</i> were
of the more abbreviated and functional type.</p>

<p>In 1918 Annette Kellerman recommended that
serious swimmers wear close-fitting swimming tights
or the two-piece suits commonly worn by men. Being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
quick to admit that this costume would not be tolerated
at all beaches, she told dedicated swimmers to</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>... get one-piece tights anyway and wear over the tights
the lightest garment you can get. It should be a loose
sleeveless garment hung from the shoulders. Never have
a tight waist band. It is a hindrance. Also on beaches
where stockings are enforced your one-piece undergarment
should have feet, so that the separate stocking
and its attendant garter is abolished.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p></div>

<p>Knitted swimming suits found in advertisements of
the period were either one-piece or two-piece; the
trunks were attached or separate, but they always
extended a few inches below the brief skirt. Although
this costume could be considered sleeveless, in some
examples the suit was built up under the arm&mdash;a concession
to the demands of modesty (<a href="#Fig16">fig. 16</a>). The
scooped or &#8220;<span class="lettsymb">V</span>&#8221; neckline with no collar was relatively
high; in order to put on or remove the suit it was unbuttoned
at one shoulder.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><a name="Fig16" id="Fig16"></a>

<p class="caption">Figure 16.&mdash;<span class="smcap">One-piece swimming suit of knitted
wool</span>, c. 1918. (Smithsonian photo P-65413.)</p></div>

<p>It was this type of swimming costume which evolved
into the garment that dominated the fashion pages of
the mid-1920s.</p>

<p>Changes in costume brought about by the acceptance
of swimming also affected leg covering. By 1920
fashion pages showed stockings that reached only to
the calf and many advertisements for the abbreviated
knitted bathing suits presented the lower leg covered
with only the high laced bathing shoe (<a href="#Fig17">fig. 17</a>) or, in a
few cases, bare. Bathing slippers were black satin or
black or white canvas held on the feet by ribbon criss-crossed
up the leg to tie at mid-calf. Shoes were of
satin or canvas, laced in the front to mid-calf.</p>

<p>There was a wide variety of colorful rubber caps;
some were gathered on a band or with a ruffle while
others were closely fitted with brims. Also popular
was a close-fitting rubber cap with a colorful scarf tied
around it; swimmers did without the scarf.</p>

<p>Despite the distinction between the two types of
bathing apparel, the beach cloak continued to be used
by both the serious swimmer and those who stayed
safely in the shallows. Some bathing wraps had large
collars and were only mid-calf in length. Colorful
beach hats, beach parasols, bags, and blankets were
used, particularly by the bather who seldom got wet.</p>

<p>The acceptance of swimming as a feminine activity
provided an impetus for the use of the knitted swimming
suit; but standards of modesty had to change
before this suit could gain wide acceptance. Bathing
dresses of the 19th century had been designed to
cover, conceal, and obscure not only the torso but the
limbs as well. The swimming suit that was gaining
acceptance in the early 1920s not only revealed the
arms and a good part of the legs, but actually dared to
follow the lines of the torso. Contemporary descriptions,
that seem amusingly cautious today, included
such statements as &#8220;... all Annette Kellerman Bathing
Attire is distinguished by an incomparable, daring
beauty of fit that always remains refined.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_59"
id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Even
less cautious was a statement that these bathing suits
were &#8220;famous ... for their perfect fit and exquisite,
plastic beauty of line.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The growing numbers of women who wore the
new styles of bathing dress were a cause of concern to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
self-appointed guardians of decency. In 1917 the
convention of the American Association of Park
Superintendents at New Orleans adopted a series
of bathing regulations for city beaches which dealt
with the problems of the changing bathing suit. In
general these regulations specified that &#8220;... No all-white
or flesh-colored suits are permitted or suits that
expose the chest lower than a line drawn on a level
with the arm pits.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a
href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> In regard to ladies&#8217; bathing
suits these men agreed that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Blouse and bloomer suits may be worn with or without
stockings, provided the blouse has quarter-arm sleeves or
close-fitting arm holes, and provided the bloomers are
full and not shorter than four inches above the knee.<a name="FNanchor_62"
id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p></div>

<p>Regulations for knitted suits were similar, with the
added caution that the skirt hem could be no more
than two inches above the lower edge of the trunks.
As late as 1923 these regulations were in effect at
public beaches in Cleveland and Chicago.</p>

<p>By 1923 a permanent change was occurring in the
design of beach apparel. The chemise-style bathing
dress of black taffeta or satin still appeared in the
fashion magazines (<a href="#Fig15">fig. 15</a>), but by 1929 it had disappeared.
The result of the struggle between the fancy
bathing suit and the plain knitted suit became obvious
even in the popular magazines of the period. In the
opening paragraphs of a short story, Shirley, the villainess,
donned a smart bathing suit of puffy black
taffeta, with a patent-leather belt and a scarlet scarf,
and baked in the shadow of a big umbrella. Margaret,
the heroine, in a plain knitted suit and black cap was
intent only upon diving, plunging, and splashing for
her own enjoyment. In another story a young lady,
who came out of the sea wearing a &#8220;... bathing suit
so scanty it seemed a mere gesture flung carelessly to
the proprieties ...&#8221; described herself as a modern
young woman.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>In the early twenties advertisements capitalized on
the functional characteristics of swimming suits. A
1923 advertisement declared:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>No! No! Not a bathing suit! No! The Wil Wite is a
swimming suit. The difference is great&mdash;very great. A
bathing suit is something in which to &#8220;Sun&#8221; oneself and
wear on the beach. A swimming suit is a garment made
expressly for those who swim. It is free from frills and
furbelows. It follows the form with the same sincerity
that a neat silk stocking clings to a trim ankle. It fits when
dry or wet ... it is a real swimming suit.<a name="FNanchor_64"
id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p></div>

<p>The knitted swimming suit which achieved dominance
over the bathing suit in the 1920s was similar to
its earlier version except that both the armhole and
the neckline were lower. This made it possible to put
on the suit without unbuttoning one of the straps at
the shoulder&mdash;a feature that was omitted in this newer
style. Sometimes a sash was looped loosely around the
waist; a geometrically shaped monogram provided a
smart decoration. The affluent swimmer could distinguish
herself from the masses by wearing silk jersey.
During the last half of this decade women coquettishly
adopted a man&#8217;s swimming suit, consisting of a
striped sleeveless jersey shirt with dark colored trunks
and a white belt.</p>

<p>Perhaps the last stand for the bathing dress was the
appearance of the &#8220;dressmaker suit&#8221; toward the end
of the 1920s and on into the early 1930s. The neck and
shoulder line copied those of currently fashionable
evening dresses, with a parallel treatment of the skirt,
which was shortened to end just below the hips. This
suit was worn by women reluctant to brave the revealingly
unadorned but popular swimming suit.</p>

<p>A depilatory advertisement took advantage of the
increasing &#8220;stockingless vogue&#8221; and explained that
&#8220;Women who love swimming for the sake of the sport,
find stockings a great hindrance to their enjoyment.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_65"
id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65</a>]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
By the end of the twenties, the stocking for bathing and
swimming had become an article of the past.</p>

<p>Although women were accepted in athletics and
had achieved a generally wider role in public life,
white, untanned skin was still the ideal in the 1920s.
Thus sunproof creams, beach coats, and beach umbrellas
were still important.</p>

<p>According to the well-known &#8220;trickle-down&#8221;
theory of fashion, styles of dress first become fashionable
among the socially elite and wealthy and are
then, in time, emulated by those at lower socio-economic
levels. The knitted swimming suit, however,
entered the fashion pages by a different route. It had
its insignificant start with the skirtless bifurcated
garments of the late 1860s. Going against popular
opinion, some women did swim. They violated prevalent
standards of modesty by continuing to wear a
functional suit. Gradually the demand grew. A plain,
utilitarian garment was needed; pressure increased.
Thus, by the 1920s the swimming suit prevailed,
complimenting the image of the newly emancipated
&#8220;modern woman.&#8221;</p>

<h3>SWIM SUIT INDUSTRY</h3>

<p>Along with the increased popularity of swimming
and the appearance of the knitted swimming suit we
note the rapid development of the ready-to-wear
swim suit industry. During the last half of the 19th
century women frequently made their own bathing
dresses with the aid of paper pattern supplements
that appeared in women&#8217;s magazines of the period.
Dressmakers also may have used these patterns to
outfit their clients for their summer excursions. On the
other hand, ladies in the large cities could purchase
bathing dresses at furnishing stores or rent them at
the large public beaches. A small advertisement in
<i>Harper&#8217;s Bazar</i>, August 9, 1873, announced that in
addition to gauze undershirts, linen drawers, collars
and cuffs, Union Adams &amp; Co. of New York had
bathing dresses for sale. The notice is noteworthy
when one considers that the ready-to-wear clothing
industry and the field of advertising were in their
infancy.</p>

<p>With the increased popularity of the knitted suit,
knitting mills included men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s swimming
apparel in their more prosaic lines of underwear and
sweaters. Many companies advertised the new product,
steadily increasing their range until the inevitable
occurred. In 1921 a national advertising campaign
for swimming suits was initiated by Jantzen, a
hitherto obscure knitting mill whose production had
been limited to sweaters, woolen hosiery, and jackets
for Chinese workmen. Capitalizing on the growing
interest in swimming, Jantzen prominently advertised
swimming suits instead of bathing dresses. The
retail stores selling these suits advertised locally,
but national advertising became the domain of the
manufacturers, educating the public to associate
certain positive qualities with their names.</p>

<p>To the delight of the swim suit industry, swimming
was more than a passing vogue. In 1934, a National
Recreation Association study on the use of leisure
time found that among ninety-four free-time activities
swimming was second only to movies in popularity.<a name="FNanchor_66"
id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
Although the number of swimmers was increasing,
competition caused the swim suit industry to take
a new approach. Manufacturers attempted to increase
the volume of sales through advertising by emphasizing
style. In 1927 one company advertised a national
appeal to woman&#8217;s vanity by declaring that beach
<i>uniforms</i> were out and that beach <i>styles</i> were in.</p>

<p>It was a general characteristic of the 1930s that
swimming suits covered less of the bather. The
attached trunks of the swimming suit no longer
extended down the leg but it survived unseen beneath
the vestigial remains of a skirt.</p>

<p>The diminishing coverage of the swim suit was also
related to a changing attitude toward sun exposure.
For years women had protected their delicate skin
to prevent any unladylike, healthy appearance. The
barrier against a lady having a tan deteriorated as
women became accepted into athletic activities.
By 1930, women eagerly sought a sun tan. Not
only were there lotions to help the neophyte sun-worshiper
acquire a rich even tan, but creams were
available for the impatient who wished an instant
tan. In line with this trend, swim suit manufacturers
and sellers promoted and sold low sun-back or
California styles, halter necks, and cut-out sections
that exposed various portions of the midriff. The
favorite suit, however, was the form-fitting maillot
of wool jersey with no skirt.</p>

<p>In the early 1930s, the textile trade journals
applauded the increasing stress on styling as a means
of encouraging the consumer to buy a new suit
rather than to use &#8220;last year&#8217;s.&#8221; Stylishness was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
introduced into knitted suits through the use of a
greater range of solid colors. Parti-colored suits,
with stripes and slashes of a second or even a third
color, were also featured (<a href="#Fig18">fig. 18</a>). Knitting mills
were pressed to introduce novelty effects such as
mesh, waffle motifs, and lace patterns in knitted
fabrics.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig18" id="Fig18"></a>
<img src="images/illo65.jpg" alt="Ten Woolen Knitted Swimming Suits" width="500" height="285" />
<p class="caption">Figure 18. <span class="smcap">One-piece swimming suits of knitted wool</span>, 1930.

<p>The insistent emphasis on novelty encouraged the
development of such items as all-rubber swimming
suits with embossed surfaces simulating knitted textiles.
Although this innovation was not successful,
because the suits were clammy and easily torn, rubber
did find a definite use in swimming suits with the
introduction of Lastex&mdash;a yarn made with a core of
rubber wrapped by a fine thread of another fiber.
The following advertisement for swimming suits made
with Lastex best explains why this important innovation
is still valued by the industry today:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There&#8217;s no wrinkle, no bag, no sag, even under the most
ruthless sun! No other human device can even approximate
that utter freedom, that perfection of fit, at rest or
in motion, that airy but strictly legal sense of wearing
nothing at all. There is no substitute for this elastic yarn,
which imparts lasting elasticity to any fabric.<a name="FNanchor_67"
id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p></div>

<p>Having exhausted the novelty effects of knitted
swim suits, women in the late 1930s began to respond
eagerly to the wide range of decorative possibilities
found in woven fabrics. Cotton and the relatively new
man-made fibers such as Celanese acetate and Dupont
rayon were used in fabrics such as ginghams, chambrays,
piques, and featherweight elastic satins. To the
pleasure of the fashion editors, who claimed to be
anxious for some relief from the nudity of the maillot,
suits of woven fabrics were made with flared skirts.
These had knitted linings of cotton, acetate, or wool
which satisfied any taste as to warmth or coolness on
the beach. The belief was prevalent that a wool
swimming suit was needed for warmth. In the 1940s
the two-piece, bare-midriff suit with tight shorts or
flared skirt was a popular and logical development
from the earlier suits with cut-out sections around the
midriff. The more extreme French bikini, however,
was not adopted by American women when it was
first introduced in the 1940s.</p>

<p>By the end of the forties the one-piece swimming suit
staged a comeback with a slight variation: the new
suits were structurally sculptured to mold, control,
and stay put while swimming or sunning. They were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the product of ingenious engineering, inside and out.
The use of shirring and skillful cutting and handling of
fabric focused attention on the bust line, while the
frequent use of Lastex tended to streamline the hips
like a girdle. Inside, the careful use of wire and plastic
boning permitted many of these suits to assume a
shape of their own and even to be worn without
straps.</p>

<p>A short-lived revival of the covered-up look appeared
in the fashion pages in 1954 but, unlike the
suits with covered arms and neck of the previous
century, these suits drew attention to the parts of
the body that were covered. The fate of this unsuccessful
novelty is a good illustration of the fact
that, ultimately, the buyer has the final word in the
volatile field of feminine fashion. The swim suit
manufacturers apparently misinterpreted the American
woman&#8217;s readiness to discard the more revealing
two-piece suit in favor of an altered form of the
maillot. Always ready with novelties to make last
year&#8217;s suit obsolete, the manufacturers tried to encourage
women into a more extreme covered-up
look. Despite the power of national advertising women
were unwilling to go back in time. The female beach-goer
and sun-worshiper opposed a suit that might
interfere with the tanning process.</p>

<p>By 1960, the production of swim suits had become
a big business with mass distribution and mass markets.
Expanded world-wide transportation facilities
and increased leisure and affluence in the United
States created a demand for midwinter vacation
clothing for use in warmer climates, and the manufacturing
of swim suits became a year-round undertaking,
producing 14,728 million knitted and woven
suits in women&#8217;s, misses, and junior sizes in 1960.<a name="FNanchor_68"

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>The earliest bathing dress for women in the United
States may have been an old smock or shift, followed
by a bathing gown based on the shift or chemise.
Although women&#8217;s bathing and swimming costume
achieved an identity of its own during the 19th
century, the evolution of this garb followed certain
innovations in women&#8217;s underclothing, namely,
drawers in the first half of the 19th century, the
&#8220;combination&#8221; of the late 1870s, and the brassiere
and panties of the 1930s. The greatest number of
minor style changes, however, were direct reflections
of fashions in street dress. The rising hemline and,
at times, the discarding of a skirt during periods
when women wore long dresses for other activities
can be attributed to changes caused by the functional
requirements of bathing and swimming; the
shortening of sleeves and trousers in the last quarter
of the 19th century were also functional improvements.
The benefits of the shorter trousers, however,
were minimized when modesty required women to
cover their exposed legs with stockings.</p>

<p>Swimming suits have been considered a 20th
century innovation; in fact one corporation is under
the impression that a member of their staff was
responsible for the first use of the term &#8220;swimming
suit&#8221; early in the century. The findings presented
in this paper show that some women were wearing
&#8220;swimming suits&#8221; that were distinctly different
from bathing dresses as early as the 1870s and that both
co-existed for some 50 years. Bathing dresses disappeared
in the 1920s with the widespread acceptance
of its functional counterpart; &#8220;bathing suit&#8221; no
longer referred to a special type of costume but became
interchangeable with the term &#8220;swimming suit.&#8221;</p>

<p>The insistent trend toward more functional costume
reached its ultimate conclusion with the refinements
of the knitted swimming suit in the 1930s. Subsequent
changes have not improved upon the functional
design of this classic suit. In many instances these
variations have been merely to satisfy the feminine
desire for distinctive apparel and the industry&#8217;s
need for perishable fashions. Female competitive
swimmers have continued to wear the simple knitted
suit&mdash;now of nylon rather than wool.</p>

<p>The changes since the 1930s have shown a trend
toward diminution in the coverage of the swimming
suit. One cannot be certain what this means for the
future, but it is unlikely that either the swim suit
industry or standards of modesty of the near future
will permit a total elimination of swimming costume.
We can be assured, however, that so long as women
swim, they will not repeat history by swathing themselves
with yards of fabric.</p>

The term &#8220;bathing suit&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;bathing dress&#8221;
came into use in the last quarter of the 19th century when the
bifurcated bathing garment with a shorter skirt was widely
accepted. The two terms, however, continued to be used interchangeably,
with &#8220;bathing dress&#8221; appearing less frequently.</p>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
